# book-management-system
## About
A command-line application to manage an inventory of books.  
- I developed this application as a project based approach to learn C++.

## Separation of concerns
While developing this application, I tried to separate the concerns into their own implementaton files.
- InputHandler class deals with user input
- DataHandler class performs operations from the result of a user input

## Future updates and application legacy
- While building this app, I wasn't very familiar with C++ syntax. Since then I've become very familiar with C++ through the various assignments I've completed for my school courses.
- I intend to enhance and optimize this application by implementing best practices in C++
