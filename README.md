# book-management-system
## About
CMD application to manage an inventory of books.  
- I developed this application as a project based approach to learn C++.

## Separation of concerns
While developing this application, I tried to separate the concerns into their own implementaton files.
- InputHandler class deals with user input
- DataHandler class performs operations from the result of a user input

## Current bugs and future updates
- I've since realized that not all of my files should be hpp. Need to create hpp files for the class prototypes and cpp files for the class implementation
